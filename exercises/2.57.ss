Exercise 2.57: Extend the differentiation program to handle
sums and products of arbitrary numbers of (two or more)
terms. Then the last example above could be expressed as

(deriv '(* x y (+ x 3)) 'x)

Try to do this by changing only the representation for sums
and products, without changing the "deriv" procedure at all.
For example, the "addend" of a sum would be the first term,
and the "augend" would be the sum of the rest of the terms.
