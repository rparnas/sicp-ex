Exercise 3.62: Use the results of Exercise 3.60 and Exercise
3.61 to define a procedure "div-series" that divides two
power series. "div-series" should work for any two series,
provided that the denominator series begins with a nonzero
constant term. (If the denominator has a zero constant term,
then "div-series" should signal an error.) Show how to use
"div-series" together with the result of Exercise 3.59 to
generate the power series for tangent.
