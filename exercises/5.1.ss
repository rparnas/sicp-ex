Exercise 5.1: Design a register machine to compute
factorials using the iterative algorithm specified by the
following procedure. Draw data-path and controller diagrams
for this machine.

(define (factorial n)
  (define (iter product counter)
    (if (> counter n)
        product
        (iter (* counter product)
              (+ counter 1))))
  (iter 1 1))
