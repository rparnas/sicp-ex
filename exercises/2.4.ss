Exercise 2.4: Here is an alternative procedural
representation of pairs. For this representation, verify
that "(car (cons x y))" yields "x" for any objects "x" and
"y".

(define (cons x y)
  (lambda (m) (m x y)))
(define (car z)
  (z (lambda (p q) p)))

What is the corresponding definition of "cdr"? (Hint: To
verify that this works, make use of the substitution model
of Section 1.1.5.)
