Exercise 4.70: What is the purpose of the "let" bindings in
the procedures "add-assertion!" and "add-rule!" ? What would
be wrong with the following implementation of
"add-assertion!" ? Hint: Recall the definition of the
infinite stream of ones in Section 3.5.2: "(define ones
(cons-stream 1 ones))".

(define (add-assertion! assertion)
  (store-assertion-in-index assertion)
  (set! THE-ASSERTIONS
        (cons-stream assertion THE-ASSERTIONS))
  'ok)
