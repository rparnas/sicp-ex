Exercise 5.51: Develop a rudimentary implementation of
Scheme in C (or some other low-level language of your
choice) by translating the explicit-control evaluator of
Section 5.4 into C. In order to run this code you will need
to also provide appropriate storage-allocation routines and
other run-time support.
