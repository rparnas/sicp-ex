Exercise 2.51: Define the "below" operation for painters.
"below" takes two painters as arguments. The resulting
painter, given a frame, draws with the first painter in the
bottom of the frame and with the second painter in the top.
Define "below" in two different ways---first by writing a
procedure that is analogous to the "beside" procedure given
above, and again in terms of "beside" and suitable rotation
operations (from Exercise 2.50).
