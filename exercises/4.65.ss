Exercise 4.65: Cy D. Fect, looking forward to the day when
he will rise in the organization, gives a query to find all
the wheels (using the "wheel" rule of Section 4.4.1):

(wheel ?who)

To his surprise, the system responds

 ;;; Query results: 
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Bitdiddle Ben))
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))

Why is Oliver Warbucks listed four times?
