Exercise 5.33: Consider the following definition of a
factorial procedure, which is slightly different from the
one given above:

(define (factorial-alt n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* n (factorial-alt (- n 1)))))

Compile this procedure and compare the resulting code with
that produced for "factorial". Explain any differences you
find. Does either program execute more efficiently than the
other?
