Exercise 4.62: Define rules to implement the "last-pair"
operation of Exercise 2.17, which returns a list containing
the last element of a nonempty list. Check your rules on
queries such as "(last-pair (3) ?x)", "(last-pair (1 2 3)
?x)" and "(last-pair (2 ?x) (3))". Do your rules work
correctly on queries such as "(last-pair ?x (3))" ?
