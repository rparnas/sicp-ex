Exercise 3.19: Redo Exercise 3.18 using an algorithm that
takes only a constant amount of space. (This requires a very
clever idea.)

#| Answer

My answer already uses a constant amount of space:
1) frame for is-cycle
2) frame for iter, which is tail call optimized

This may be incorrect, the answer they are looking for may be
the rabbit and hare algorithm.
