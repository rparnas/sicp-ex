Exercise 3.57: How many additions are performed when we
compute the n^(th) Fibonacci number using the definition of
"fibs" based on the "add-streams" procedure? Show that the
number of additions would be exponentially greater if we had
implemented "(delay <exp>)" simply as "(lambda () <exp>)",
without using the optimization provided by the "memo-proc"
procedure described in Section 3.5.1.
