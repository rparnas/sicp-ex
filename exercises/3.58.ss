Exercise 3.58: Give an interpretation of the stream computed
by the following procedure:

(define (expand num den radix)
  (cons-stream
   (quotient (* num radix) den)
   (expand (remainder (* num radix) den) den radix)))

("quotient" is a primitive that returns the integer quotient
of two integers.) What are the successive elements produced
by "(expand 1 7 10)"? What is produced by "(expand 3 8 10)"?
