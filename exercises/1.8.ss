Exercise 1.8: Newton's method for cube roots is based on the
fact that if y is an approximation to the cube root of x,
then a better approximation is given by the value

x/y^2 + 2y

Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure
analogous to the square-root procedure. (In Section 1.3.4 we
will see how to implement Newton's method in general as an
abstraction of these square-root and cube-root procedures.)
