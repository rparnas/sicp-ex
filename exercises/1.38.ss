Exercise 1.38: In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard
Euler published a memoir De Fractionibus Continuis, which
included a continued fraction expansion for e - 2, where e
is the base of the natural logarithms. In this fraction, the
N_i are all 1, and the D_i are successively 1, 2, 1, 1, 4,
1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8,.... Write a program that uses your
"cont-frac" procedure from Exercise 1.37 to approximate e,
based on Euler's expansion.
