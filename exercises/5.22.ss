Exercise 5.22: Exercise 3.12 of Section 3.3.1 presented an
"append" procedure that appends two lists to form a new list
and an "append!" procedure that splices two lists together.
Design a register machine to implement each of these
procedures. Assume that the list-structure memory operations
are available as primitive operations.
