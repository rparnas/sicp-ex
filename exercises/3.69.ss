Exercise 3.69: Write a procedure "triples" that takes three
infinite streams, S, T, and U, and produces the stream of
triples (S_i, T_j, U_k) such that i <= j <= k. Use "triples"
to generate the stream of all Pythagorean triples of
positive integers, i.e., the triples (i, j, k) such that i
<= j and i^2 + j^2 = k^2.
