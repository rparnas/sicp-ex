Exercise 3.48: Explain in detail why the deadlock-avoidance
method described above, (i.e., the accounts are numbered,
and each process attempts to acquire the smaller-numbered
account first) avoids deadlock in the exchange problem.
Re-write "serialized-exchange" to incorporate this idea.
(You will also need to modify "make-account" so that each
account is created with a number, which can be accessed by
sending an appropriate message.)
