Exercise 1.11: A function f is defined by the rule that

       /
       | n                           if n < 3
f(n) = < f(n-1) + 2f(n-2) + 3f(n-3)  if n >= 3
       |
       \

Write a procedure that computes f by means of a recursive
process. Write a procedure that computes f by means of an
iterative process.
