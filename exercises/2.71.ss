Exercise 2.71: Suppose we have a Huffman tree for an
alphabet of n symbols, and that the relative frequencies of
the symbols are 1, 2, 4,..., 2^(n-1). Sketch the tree for
n=5; for n=10. In such a tree (for general n) how many bits
are required to encode the most frequent symbol? The least
frequent symbol?
