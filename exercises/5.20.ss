Exercise 5.20: Draw the box-and-pointer representation and
the memory-vector representation (as in Figure 5.14) of the
list structure produced by

(define x (cons 1 2))
(define y (list x x))

with the "free" pointer initially "p1". What is the final
value of "free" ? What pointers represent the values of "x"
and "y" ?
