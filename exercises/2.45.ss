Exercise 2.45: "right-split" and "up-split" can be expressed
as instances of a general splitting operation. Define a
procedure "split" with the property that evaluating

(define right-split (split beside below))
(define up-split (split below beside))

produces procedures "right-split" and "up-split" with the
same behaviors as the ones already defined.
