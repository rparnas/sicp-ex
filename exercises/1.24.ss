Exercise 1.24: Modify the "timed-prime-test" procedure of
Exercise 1.22 to use "fast-prime?" (the Fermat method), and
test each of the 12 primes you found in that exercise. Since
the Fermat test has Theta(log n) growth, how would you
expect the time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare
with the time needed to test primes near 1000? Do your data
bear this out? Can you explain any discrepancy you find?
